# thingSoC

**thingSoC** is an open source standard that defines a
vendor independent socket system for the creation of new Internet Things;
it addresses many of the limitations of current product offerings
and standards, by adding capabilities such as automatic device discovery, 
device configuration, monitoring, instrumentation, and testing.

**thingSoC** works with many existing standards and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs),
such as Arduino, rfDuino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglbone, X-Bee, and others;
but adds features and capabilites that make building new IoT devices much easier. 

The **thingSoC** virtual platform definition supports a number of different System-on-Chip platforms and peripherals,
such as cell modems, packet radios, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and more.

## Reference Design Index <a name="reference_index"/>

**thingSoC Reference Designs** are example thingSoC implementations that implement
various reference and testing circuits for demonstrating the use of the thingSoC libraries.
These reference designs can serve as starting templates for user designs.
Feel free to remix and customize as needed.

Name           | Reference Design         | Notes 
------------   | ------------------------ | -----
USB-CDC-BASE   | USB UART Base Board      | Base Boards utilize female sockets        
USB-CDC-EXPB   | USB UART Expansion Board | Expansion Boards utilize male pins
