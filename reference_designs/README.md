**thingSoC Reference Designs** are a library of thingSoC implementations that implement
 reference and testing circuits for demonstrating the use of the thingSoC libraries.
These reference designs can be used and adapted as starting templates for user designs.



Name           | Reference Design         | Notes 
------------   | ------------------------ | -----
USB-CDC-BASE   | USB UART Base Board      | Base Boards utilize female sockets        
USB-CDC-EXPB   | USB UART Expansion Board | Expansion Boards utilize male pins        
XBEE-EXPB      | XBee Socket Adaptor      | XBee Radio to thingSoC adaptor        
MIKROBUS-EXPB  | Mikrobus Socket Adaptor  | Mikrobus to thingSoC adaptor        
---------------------------------------------------------------



**thingSoC** is an open source standard that defines a
vendor independent socket system for the creation of new Internet Things;
it addresses many of the limitations of current product offerings
and standards, by adding capabilities such as automatic device discovery, 
automatic device configuration, self-monitoring, and self-testing.
