# thingSoC

**thingSoC** is an open source standard that defines a
vendor independent socket system for the creation of new Internet Things;
it addresses many of the limitations of current product offerings
and standards, by adding capabilities such as automatic device discovery, 
automatic device configuration, self-monitoring, and self-testing. 

**thingSoC** works with many existing standards and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs),
such as Arduino, rfDuino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglbone, X-Bee, and others;
but adds  new features and new capabilites to make building new IoT devices easy.

The **thingSoC** virtual platform definition supports a number of different System-on-Chip platforms and peripherals,
such as cell modems, packet radios, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and more. 
Documentation is available on the [thingSoC Organization Website](http://thingSoC.github.io)
