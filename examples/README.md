# thingSoC Examples

**thingSoC** is an open source standard that defines a
vendor independent socket system for the creation of new Internet Things;
it addresses many of the limitations of current product offerings
and standards, by adding capabilities such as automatic device discovery, 
device configuration, monitoring, instrumentation, and testing.

**thingSoC** works with many existing standards and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs),
such as Arduino, rfDuino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglbone, X-Bee, and others;
but adds features and capabilites that make building new IoT devices much easier. 

The **thingSoC** virtual platform definition supports a number of different System-on-Chip platforms and peripherals,
such as cell modems, packet radios, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and more.

## thingSoC Reference Designs <a name="reference_designs"/>

**thingSoC Reference Designs** are example thingSoC implementations that implement
various reference and testing circuits for demonstrating the use of the thingSoC libraries.
These reference designs can serve as starting templates for user designs.
