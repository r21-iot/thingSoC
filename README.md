thingSoC - System on Chip Platform for the Internet of Things - Reference Platforms

thingSoC is a modular development platform for the Internet of Things,
that addresses many of the limitations of current product offerings;
such as automatic device discovery, automatic device configuration,
and self testing capabilities.

thingSoC is currently in alpha testing, 
and we expect to have a beta release candidate
available here on Github in early April 2015.

thingSoC is an Open Source Hardware (OSHW) project,
and will be freely available for community development.

Documentation is available on the Organization Website at http://thingSoC.github.io
